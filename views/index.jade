            &ldquo;I love my wrap! It's awesome! I have the maxi in black, which I like to wear either 
            as a layer or belted.  I've worn it out to art gallery openings, and as a beach cover-up.  
            The fabric is comfy and easy... I've taken it with me on several trips, and it doesn't wrinkle!&rdquo;

            &ldquo;I LOVE my "wrap-it-by-Tish!"  It is so versatile and easy to wear and wash.  Plus, the color 
            selection is awesome.  It's great for travel since you can use it in various ways which makes it possible 
            for one to take less clothing on the trip.&rdquo;

            Love my wraps. Recently went to a wedding in the Dominican Republic and had three wraps with me. 
            I wore one to the beach ceremony, a maxi out to dinner, and the other over my bathing suit.  
            Everyone asked about it and loved it.  Easy to travel with and simple to care for.

            Awesome concept. Tish's wraps are fun!  You can give it a creative twist and wear it 
            poolside, or you might prefer to use it long and one shouldered for a nice dinner date.  
            Great for travel, no wrinkles.  I chose mine in bright aqua, and the quality and color are top notch.

            These wraps are a must-have in any wardrobe, for all body types and all ages.  
            They are versatile, easy,  travel extremely well and so fun to wear!  The colors and fabric are wonderful.  
            Thanks, Tish, for a fabulous item! I love my wrapitbytish.
